# Angular Universal Express

A boilerplate for Angular Universal in Express with Angular CLI integration. This leverages the ['Universal Starter'](https://github.com/angular/universal-starter) and adds the CLI on top. Start by running `npm install`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Development server

In one terminal window run `ng build --watch`, which monitors client-side Angular changes in the open. Open another terminal window and run `ng build --app 1 --watch`, which monitors server-side Angular changes. Then, open a third terminal window and run `p2m start dist/server/main.bundle.js --watch`. This starts the server for us.
